Yipeng's Notes: 

Make and run as such: 
./multijoin conf/confName.conf <parms>

Possible parms options
Hash - H-BNL

 INTRODUCTION 
==============

This is the code used to study the performance of various main-memory hash join
algorithms for the following SIGMOD 2011 paper:

Spyros Blanas, Yinan Li, Jignesh M. Patel: Design and evaluation of main
memory hash join algorithms for multi-core CPUs. In SIGMOD Conference, 
p. 37-48, 2011.


Feel free to experiment with the code, and please share any finidings and
improvements you've made with the community.

 GETTING STARTED
=================

1. Fix the thread affinitization for your particular machine/OS, by editing
affinitizer.cpp, lines 39-44. The program will throw an exception by
default if it is unset, because this is required for consistent readings
of the tick counter (via rdtsc).
 

2. Generate a uniform dataset: 

$ cd datagen/
$ ./generate.sh
$ cd ..

After a few minutes, the datagen/ directory will contain two files: 
(a) the build side, "016M_build.tbl", a 256+ MB file with 16M tuples
(b) the probe side, "256M_probe.tbl", a 4+ GB file with 256M tuples


3. Compile:

$ make


4. Make sure libconfig++.so is in your path by doing:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/dist/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


5. Run with a sample configuration file. Let's pick the non-partitioning
algorithm:

$ ./multijoin conf/000001_no.conf

The data that was generated in step 2 will first be loaded in memory (takes a
while depending on your I/O speed), then the algorithm will run (takes
seconds), and will output the something like this:

RUNTIME TOTAL, BUILD+PART, PART (cycles): 
16160005234 326706098   129240

The reported results are cumulative across phases, so you should not add the
three numbers together. In the example above, this means that the operation was
completed in 16,160,005,234 cycles, of which 326,706,098 cycles was building
the hash table and partitioning the inputs, and 129,240 cycles was partitioning
alone (not surprising, since we don't do any partitioning for this algorithm).

The conf/gen/ subdirectory contains a .conf file generator to play with.
